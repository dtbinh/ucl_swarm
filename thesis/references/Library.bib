abstract = {The success of the Particle Swarm Optimiza-tion (PSO) algorithm as a single-objective optimizer (mainly when dealing with continuous search spaces) has motivated re-searchers to extend the use of this bio-inspired technique to other areas. One of them is multi-objective optimization. De-spite the fact that the first proposal of a Multi-Objective Par-ticle Swarm Optimizer (MOPSO) is over six years old, a con-siderable number of other algorithms have been proposed since then. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the vari-ous MOPSOs reported in the specialized literature. As part of this review, we include a classification of the approaches, and we identify the main features of each proposal. In the last part of the paper, we list some of the topics within this field that we consider as promising areas of future research.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a heuristic search technique that iteratively im-proves a set of candidate solutions given an objective measure of fitness (Kennedy and Eberhart 1995b). Although vanilla implementations of PSO can be found in some Python evolutionary algorithm toolboxes (Fortin et al. 2012; Biscani, Izzo, and M{\"{a}}rtens 2017), a PSO-specific library that focuses on the said technique is still an open challenge. PySwarms is a research toolkit for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that provides a set of class primitives useful for solving continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. It follows a black-box approach, solving optimization tasks with few lines of code, yet allows a white-box framework with a consistent API for rapid prototyping of non-standard swarm models. In addition, benchmark objective functions and parameter-search tools are included to evaluate and improve swarm performance. It is intended for swarm intelligence researchers, practitioners, and students who would like a high-level declarative interface for implementing PSO in their problems.},

abstract = {The problem of coordinating construction vehicles in formations is tackled using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Coordinated multi-vehicles are anticipated to outperform single vehicles in terms of economy and flexibility. A possible approach is to apply control theoretic methods to vehicle coordination but this may require complicated system models to be employed. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm adopted in this work, as an evolutionary computation based methodology, is able to provide a near-optimal solution without the need for a precise system model. The control commands for the vehicles are treated as particles in a swarm and a sequence of controls is derived to achieve the desired formation. With regard to inter-vehicle collision avoidances, behaviour-based control strategies are incorporated into the formation framework. Simulations for multi-vehicle formation in a construction site scenario are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In this work, we first formulate the inspection path planning problem as an extended travelling salesman problem (TSP) in which both the coverage and obstacle avoidance were taken into account. An enhanced discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm is then proposed to solve the TSP, with performance improvement by using deterministic initialization, random mutation, and edge exchange. Finally, we take advantage of parallel computing to implement the DPSO in a GPU-based framework so that the computation time can be significantly reduced while keeping the hardware requirement unchanged. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experimental results are included for datasets obtained from UAV inspection of an office building and a bridge.},

This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to existing robot simulators, which obtain scalability by imposing limitations to the extent and accuracy of the robot models, in ARGoS we pursue a deeply modular approach that allows the user both to add custom features easily and to allocate computational resources where needed by the experiment at hand. In this respect, a unique feature of ARGoS is the possibility to use multiple physics engines for different parts of the environment. The physics engines can be of different kinds and robots can migrate from one to another in a transparent way. This feature enables a whole new set of optimizations to improve scalability and paves the way for a new approach to parallelism in robotic simulation. Results show that ARGoS can simulate about 10,000 wheeled robots with full dynamics in real-time. We discuss possible improvements to the architecture of ARGoS to achieve simulations of millions of entities in real-time.},

Swarm-based primitives allow for the dynamic management of robot teams, and for sharing information globally across the swarm. Self-organization stems from the completely decentralized mechanisms upon which the Buzz run-time platform is based. The language can be extended to add new primitives (thus supporting heterogeneous robot swarms), and its run-time platform is designed to be laid on top of other frameworks, such as Robot Operating System. We showcase the capabilities of Buzz by providing code examples, and analyze scalability and robustness of the run-time platform through realistic simulated experiments with representative swarm algorithms.},

Aggregation, flocking, foraging, object clustering and sorting, navigation, path formation, deployment, collaborative manipulation and task allocation problems are described in detail, and a high-level overview is provided for other swarm robotics tasks. For each of the main tasks, (1) swarm design methods are identified, (2) past works are divided in task-specific categories, and (3) mathematical models and performance metrics are described. Consistently with the swarm intelligence paradigm, the main focus is on studies characterized by distributed control, simplicity of individual robots and locality of sensing and communication. Distributed algorithms are shown to bring cooperation between agents, obtained in various forms and often without explicitly programming a cooperative behavior in the single robot controllers. Offline and online learning approaches are described, and some examples of past works utilizing these approaches are reviewed.},

abstract = {We present a constrained optimization method for multi-robot formation control in dynamic environments, where the robots adjust the parameters of the formation, such as size and three-dimensional orientation, to avoid collisions with static and moving obstacles, and to make progress towards their goal. We describe two variants of the algorithm, one for local motion planning and one for global path planning. The local planner first computes a large obstacle-free convex region in a neighborhood of the robots, embedded in position-time space. Then, the parameters of the formation are optimized therein by solving a constrained optimization, via sequential convex programming. The robots navigate towards the optimized formation with individual controllers that account for their dynamics. The idea is extended to global path planning by sampling convex regions in free position space and connecting them if a transition in formation is possible -computed via the constrained optimization. The path of lowest cost to the goal is then found via graph search. The method applies to ground and aerial vehicles navigating in two-and three-dimensional environments among static and dynamic obstacles, allows for reconfiguration, and is efficient and scalable with the number of robots. In particular, we consider two applications, a team of aerial vehicles navigating in formation, and a small team of mobile manipulators that collaboratively carry an object. The approach is verified in experiments with a team of three mobile manipulators and in simulations with a team of up to sixteen Micro Air Vehicles (quadrotors).},

Through simple rules and local interactions, swarm robotics aims at designing robust, scalable, and flexible collective behaviors for the coordination of large numbers of robots. In this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. Swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. We propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied. We conclude with a discussion of the current limits of swarm robotics as an engineering discipline and with suggestions for future research directions.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm applications, algorithms, and control strategies have experienced steady growth and development over the past 15 years. Yet, to date, most swarm development efforts have gone untested and unimple- mented. The major inhibitors to successful swarm implementation seem to include the cost of aircraft systems, govern- ment imposed airspace restrictions, and the lack of adequate modeling and simulation tools. This paper examines how the open-source OpenEaagles simulation framework was leveraged to bridge this gap to create Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. Leveraging OpenEaagles through software extension to create HIL simulations provides developers with a functional capability with which to develop and test the behaviors of scalable and modular swarms of autonomous UAVs. Using HIL-based simulations in this capacity provides assurance that defined behaviors will propagate to live flight tests in the real world. The demonstrations in the work show how the framework enhances and simplifies swarm devel- opment through encapsulation, possesses high modularity, provides realistic aircraft modeling, and is capable of simulta- neously accommodating multiple hardware-piloted and purely simulated swarming UAVs during simulation.},

It has already been used successfully for the simulation of several types of legged and wheeled robots equipped with cameras and laser scanners. In this paper the core functionalities of MuRoSimF are presented. Existing algorithms for simulation of the robots' motions are revised. Newly added features including the execution of the simulation on multi core CPUs and two different algorithms for the simulation of laser scanners are presented. The performance of these features is tested in an urban scenario using wheeled robots.},

As the focus is on developing algorithms, rather than rugged hardware, we are using small off-the-shelf electric quad-rotor vehicles with payloads of a few hundred grams.

Stage version 2, as the simulation backend for the Player/Stage system, may be the most commonly used robot simulator in research and university teaching today. Development of Stage version 3 has focused on improving scalability, usability, and portability. This paper examines Stage's scalability. We propose a simple benchmark for multi-robot simulator performance, and present results for Stage. Run time is shown to scale approximately linearly with population size up to 100,000 robots. For example, Stage simulates 1 simple robot at around 1,000 times faster than real time, and 1,000 simple robots at around real time. These results suggest that Stage may be useful for swarm robotics researchers who would otherwise use custom simulators, with their attendant disadvantages in terms of code reuse and transparency.},

We present a comprehensive overview of group retrieval in ants and investigate this phenomenon in Aphaenogaster cockerelli in order to extract the ants' roles during transport, the rules that govern their actions, and the individual forces that they apply to guide a food item to their nest. To measure these forces, we fabricated elastic structures with calibrated stiffness properties, induced ants to retrieve the structures, and tracked the resulting deformations with a camera. We then developed a hybrid system model of the ant behaviors that were observed in the experiments. We conducted simulations of the behavioral model that incorporate a quasi-static model of planar manipulation with compliant attachment points. Our simulations qualitatively replicate individual ant activity as well as certain macroscopic features of the transport.},

Each agent's heading is updated using a local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the headings of its "neighbors." In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide simulation results which demonstrate that the nearest neighbor rule they are studying can cause all agents to eventually move in the same direction despite the absence of centralized coordination and despite the fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors change with time as the system evolves. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for this observed behavior. In addition, convergence results are derived for several other similarly inspired models. The Vicsek model proves to be a graphic example of a switched linear system which is stable, but for which there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov function.},
