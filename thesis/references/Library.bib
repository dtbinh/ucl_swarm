abstract = {This chapter gave concrete recommendations about the use of PSO based spline-planner. Namely, a suitable PSO method with recommended parameter values is resumed and its main advantages and disadvantages are critically discussed. The original PSO with velocity clamping and linearly decreasing inertia weight performed well and was able to find better solution in shorter time than genetic algorithm. Because of strong limitations on time consumption, we do not recommend any complex modification. Among the two tested modification, the PSO with constriction coefficient could compete with the original PSO version. Finally, it was shown, how problematic is the use of PSO for formation path planning. In our cases, the only feasible paths corresponded to global optima of the cost function. A promising future direction is the modified random initialization of the swarm that can be adjusted in number of ways. The good initialization is simple instrument for improving the speed of the planning process that is for real time planning and dynamical environment response crucial.

Thanks to the recent advances of hardware technology, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are starting to be used for photogrammetric sensing of large areas in several application domains, such as agriculture, rescuing, and surveillance. However, most of the research focused on finding the optimal path taking only geometrical constraints into account, without considering the peculiar features of the robot, like available energy, weight, maximum speed, sensor resolution, etc. This paper proposes an energy-aware path planning algorithm that minimizes energy consumption while satisfying a set of other requirements, such as coverage and resolution. The algorithm is based on an energy model derived from real measurements. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through a set of experiments.},

We demonstrate the concept through examples implemented both in simulation and on a group of physical mobile robots. The basis behavior set we propose, consisting of avoidance, safe-wandering, following, aggregation, dispersion, and homing, is constructed from behaviors commonly observed in a variety of species in nature. The proposed behaviors are manifested spatially but have an effect on more abstract modes of interaction, including the exchange of information and cooperation. We demonstrate how basis behaviors can be combined into higher-level group behaviors commonly observed across species. The combination mechanisms we propose are useful for synthesizing a variety of new group behaviors, as well as for analyzing naturally occurring ones. },

abstract = {This paper surveys recent results in coverage path planning, a new path planning approach that determines a path for a robot to pass over all points in its free space. Unlike conventional point-to-point path planning, coverage path planning enables applications such as robotic de-mining, snow removal, lawn mowing, car-body painting, machine milling, etc. This paper will focus on coverage path planning algorithms for mobile robots constrained to operate in the plane. These algorithms can be classified as either heuristic or complete. It is our conjecture that most complete algorithms use an exact cellular decomposition, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve coverage. Therefore, this paper organizes the coverage algorithms into four categories: heuristic, approximate, partial-approximate and exact cellular decompositions. The final section describes some provably complete multi-robot coverage algorithms.},

The goal is to have mobile robots establish and maintain some predetermined geo-metric shape. We report results from extensive simulation exper-iments, and 40+ experiments with four physical robots, showing the viability of our approach. The key idea is that each robot keeps a single friend at a desired angle , using some appropriate sensor. By panning the sensor by degrees, the goal for all formations be-comes simply to center the friend in the sensor's field of view. We also present a general analytical measure for evaluating formations and apply it to the position data from both simulation and physical robot experiments.

abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

abstract={Recently, Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF) have been introduced as an effective means to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as well as outdoor, environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches},

abstract = { In this paper we describe a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a static environment with a mobile robot. The vast majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this paper we advocate an algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the extended information filter (EIF). We show that when represented in the information form, map posteriors are dominated by a small number of links that tie together nearby features in the map. This insight is developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called the sparse extended information filter (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks of features that are locally interconnected, where links represent relative information between pairs of nearby features, as well as information about the robot's pose relative to the map. We show that all essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed in constant time, irrespective of the size of the map. We also provide empirical results obtained for a benchmark data set collected in an outdoor environment, and using a multi-robot mapping simulation. },

abstract = {Research on closed plant production systems, such as artificially illuminated and highly insulated plant factories, has offered perspectives for urban food production but more insight is needed into their resource use efficiency. This paper assesses the potential of this ‘novel' system for production in harsh climates with either low or high temperatures and solar radiation levels. The performance of plant factories is compared with cultivation in traditional greenhouses by analysing the use of resources in the production of lettuce. We applied advanced climate models for greenhouses and buildings, coupled with a lettuce model that relates growth to microclimate. This analysis was performed for three different climate zones and latitudes (24–68°N). In terms of energy efficiency, plant factories (1411MJkg−1 dry weight) outperform even the most efficient greenhouse (Sweden with artificial illumination; 1699MJkg−1 dry weight). Additionally, plant factories achieve higher productivity for all other resources (water, CO2 and land area). With respect to purchased energy, however, greenhouses excel as they use freely available solar energy for photosynthesis. The production of 1kg dry weight of lettuce requires an input of 247kWhe in a plant factory, compared to 70, 111, 182 and 211kWhe in greenhouses in respectively the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates and Sweden (with and without additional artificial illumination). The local scarcity of resources determines the suitability of production systems. Our quantitative analysis provides insight into the effect of external climate on resource productivity in plant factories and greenhouses. By elucidating the impact of the absence of solar energy, this provides a starting point for determining the economic viability of plant factories.},

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing (SA), and tabu search (TS) are general iterative algorithms for combinatorial optimization. The term evolutionary algorithm is used to refer to any probabilistic algorithm whose design is inspired by evolutionary mechanisms found in biological species. Most widely known algorithms of this category are genetic algorithms (GA). GA, SA, and TS have been found to be very effective and robust in solving numerous problems from a wide range of application domains. Furthermore, they are even suitable for ill-posed problems where some of the parameters are not known before hand. These properties are lacking in all traditional optimization techniques. In this paper we perform a comparative study among GA, SA, and TS. These algorithms have many similarities, but they also possess distinctive features, mainly in their strategies for searching the solution state space. The three heuristics are applied on the same optimization problem and compared with respect to (1) quality of the best solution identified by each heuristic, (2) progress of the search from initial solution(s) until stopping criteria are met, (3) the progress of the cost of the best solution as a function of time (iteration count), and (4) the number of solutions found at successive intervals of the cost function. The benchmark problem used is the floorplanning of very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. This is a hard multi-criteria optimization problem. Fuzzy logic is used to combine all objective criteria into a single fuzzy evaluation (cost) function, which is then used to rate competing solutions.},

Aggregation, flocking, foraging, object clustering and sorting, navigation, path formation, deployment, collaborative manipulation and task allocation problems are described in detail, and a high-level overview is provided for other swarm robotics tasks. For each of the main tasks, (1) swarm design methods are identified, (2) past works are divided in task-specific categories, and (3) mathematical models and performance metrics are described. Consistently with the swarm intelligence paradigm, the main focus is on studies characterized by distributed control, simplicity of individual robots and locality of sensing and communication. Distributed algorithms are shown to bring cooperation between agents, obtained in various forms and often without explicitly programming a cooperative behavior in the single robot controllers. Offline and online learning approaches are described, and some examples of past works utilizing these approaches are reviewed.},

abstract = {In groups of animals only a small proportion of individuals may possess particular information, such as a migration route or the direction to a resource. Individuals may differ in preferred direction resulting in conflicts of interest and, therefore, consensus decisions may have to be made to prevent the group from splitting. Recent theoretical work has shown how leadership and consensus decision making can occur without active signalling or individual recognition. Here we test these predictions experimentally using humans. We found that a small informed minority could guide a group of na{\"{i}}ve individuals to a target without verbal communication or obvious signalling. Both the time to target and deviation from target were decreased by the presence of informed individuals. When conflicting directional information was given to different group members, the time taken to reach the target was not significantly increased; suggesting that consensus decision making in conflict situations is possible, and highly efficient. Where there was imbalance in the number of informed individuals with conflicting information, the majority dictated group direction. Our results also suggest that the spatial starting position of informed individuals influences group motion, which has implications in terms of crowd control and planning for evacuations. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

In addition, benchmark objective functions and parameter-search tools are included to evaluate and improve swarm performance.

Coordinated multi-vehicles are anticipated to outperform single vehicles in terms of economy and flexibility. A possible approach is to apply control theoretic methods to vehicle coordination but this may require complicated system models to be employed. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm adopted in this work, as an evolutionary computation based methodology, is able to provide a near-optimal solution without the need for a precise system model. The control commands for the vehicles are treated as particles in a swarm and a sequence of controls is derived to achieve the desired formation. With regard to inter-vehicle collision avoidances, behaviour-based control strategies are incorporated into the formation framework. Simulations for multi-vehicle formation in a construction site scenario are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

An enhanced discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm is then proposed to solve the TSP, with performance improvement by using deterministic initialization, random mutation, and edge exchange. Finally, we take advantage of parallel computing to implement the DPSO in a GPU-based framework so that the computation time can be significantly reduced while keeping the hardware requirement unchanged.

In contrast to existing robot simulators, which obtain scalability by imposing limitations to the extent and accuracy of the robot models, in ARGoS we pursue a deeply modular approach that allows the user both to add custom features easily and to allocate computational resources where needed by the experiment at hand. In this respect, a unique feature of ARGoS is the possibility to use multiple physics engines for different parts of the environment. The physics engines can be of different kinds and robots can migrate from one to another in a transparent way. This feature enables a whole new set of optimizations to improve scalability and paves the way for a new approach to parallelism in robotic simulation. Results show that ARGoS can simulate about 10,000 wheeled robots with full dynamics in real-time. We discuss possible improvements to the architecture of ARGoS to achieve simulations of millions of entities in real-time.},

Swarm-based primitives allow for the dynamic management of robot teams, and for sharing information globally across the swarm.

The language can be extended to add new primitives (thus supporting heterogeneous robot swarms), and its run-time platform is designed to be laid on top of other frameworks, such as Robot Operating System.

Due to the rapid development of science and technology in recent times, many effective controllers are designed and applied successfully to complicated systems. The significant task of controller design is to determine optimized control gains in a short period of time. With this purpose in mind, a combination of the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm and the evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm is introduced in this article. The benefit of this integration algorithm is the creation of new best-parameters for control design schemes. The proposed controller designs are then demonstrated to have the best performance for nonlinear micro air vehicle models.},

abstract = {We present a constrained optimization method for multi-robot formation control in dynamic environments, where the robots adjust the parameters of the formation, such as size and three-dimensional orientation, to avoid collisions with static and moving obstacles, and to make progress towards their goal. We describe two variants of the algorithm, one for local motion planning and one for global path planning. The local planner first computes a large obstacle-free convex region in a neighborhood of the robots, embedded in position-time space. Then, the parameters of the formation are optimized therein by solving a constrained optimization, via sequential convex programming. The robots navigate towards the optimized formation with individual controllers that account for their dynamics. The idea is extended to global path planning by sampling convex regions in free position space and connecting them if a transition in formation is possible -computed via the constrained optimization. The path of lowest cost to the goal is then found via graph search. The method applies to ground and aerial vehicles navigating in two-and three-dimensional environments among static and dynamic obstacles, allows for reconfiguration, and is efficient and scalable with the number of robots. In particular, we consider two applications, a team of aerial vehicles navigating in formation, and a small team of mobile manipulators that collaboratively carry an object. The approach is verified in experiments with a team of three mobile manipulators and in simulations with a team of up to sixteen Micro Air Vehicles (quadrotors).},

In this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. Swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. We propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied. We conclude with a discussion of the current limits of swarm robotics as an engineering discipline and with suggestions for future research directions.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm applications, algorithms, and control strategies have experienced steady growth and development over the past 15 years. Yet, to date, most swarm development efforts have gone untested and unimple- mented. The major inhibitors to successful swarm implementation seem to include the cost of aircraft systems, govern- ment imposed airspace restrictions, and the lack of adequate modeling and simulation tools. This paper examines how the open-source OpenEaagles simulation framework was leveraged to bridge this gap to create Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. Leveraging OpenEaagles through software extension to create HIL simulations provides developers with a functional capability with which to develop and test the behaviors of scalable and modular swarms of autonomous UAVs. Using HIL-based simulations in this capacity provides assurance that defined behaviors will propagate to live flight tests in the real world. The demonstrations in the work show how the framework enhances and simplifies swarm devel- opment through encapsulation, possesses high modularity, provides realistic aircraft modeling, and is capable of simulta- neously accommodating multiple hardware-piloted and purely simulated swarming UAVs during simulation.},

Development of Stage version 3 has focused on improving scalability, usability, and portability. This paper examines Stage's scalability. We propose a simple benchmark for multi-robot simulator performance, and present results for Stage. Run time is shown to scale approximately linearly with population size up to 100,000 robots. For example, Stage simulates 1 simple robot at around 1,000 times faster than real time, and 1,000 simple robots at around real time. These results suggest that Stage may be useful for swarm robotics researchers who would otherwise use custom simulators, with their attendant disadvantages in terms of code reuse and transparency.},

abstract = {This paper presents a generalized framework for the simulation of multiple robots and drones in highly realistic models of natural environments. The proposed simulation architecture uses the Unreal Engine4 for generating both optical and depth sensor outputs from any position and orientation within the environment and provides several key domain specific simulation capabilities. Various components and functionalities of the system have been discussed in detail. The simulation engine also allows users to test and validate a wide range of computer vision algorithms involving different drone configurations under many types of environmental effects such as wind gusts. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the system by giving experimental results for a test scenario where one drone tracks the simulated motion of another in a complex natural environment.},

abstract = {Group food retrieval in some ant species serves as a useful paradigm for multirobot collective transport strategies that are decentralized, scalable, and do not require a priori information about the payload. We present a comprehensive overview of group retrieval in ants and investigate this phenomenon in Aphaenogaster cockerelli in order to extract the ants' roles during transport, the rules that govern their actions, and the individual forces that they apply to guide a food item to their nest. To measure these forces, we fabricated elastic structures with calibrated stiffness properties, induced ants to retrieve the structures, and tracked the resulting deformations with a camera. We then developed a hybrid system model of the ant behaviors that were observed in the experiments. We conducted simulations of the behavioral model that incorporate a quasi-static model of planar manipulation with compliant attachment points. Our simulations qualitatively replicate individual ant activity as well as certain macroscopic features of the transport.},

@misc{Bertsekas2007,
abstract = {In a recent Physical Review Letters article, Vicsek et al. propose a simple but compelling discrete-time model of n autonomous agents (i.e., points or particles) all moving in the plane with the same speed but with different headings. Each agent's heading is updated using a local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the headings of its "neighbors." In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide simulation results which demonstrate that the nearest neighbor rule they are studying can cause all agents to eventually move in the same direction despite the absence of centralized coordination and despite the fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors change with time as the system evolves. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for this observed behavior. In addition, convergence results are derived for several other similarly inspired models. The Vicsek model proves to be a graphic example of a switched linear system which is stable, but for which there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov function.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recently, the application of Vertical Farming into cities has increased. Vertical farming is a cultivating vegetable vertically by new agricultural methods, which combines the design of building and farms all together in a high-rise building inside the cities. This technology needs to be manifest both in the agricultural technique and architectural technology together, however, little has been published on the technology of Vertical Farming. In this study, technology as one of the important factor of Vertical farming is discussed and reviewed by qualitative approach. In the first, identifying existing and future VF projects in Europe, Asia, and America from 2009 to 2016. Then a comprehensive literature reviewed on technologies and techniques that are used in VF projects. The study resources were formed from 62 different source from 2007 to 2016. The technologies offered can be a guide for implementation development and planning for innovative and farming industries of Vertical Farming in cities. In fact, it can act as a basis for evaluating prospective agriculture and architecture together. The integration of food production into the urban areas have been seen as a connection to the city and its residents. It simultaneously helps to reduce poverty, adds to food safety, and increases contextual sustainability and human well-being.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Current systems for greening the buildings envelope are not just surfaces covered with vegetation. Greening systems, as green roofs and green walls, are frequently used as an aesthetical feature in buildings. However, the current technology involved in these systems can maximize the functional benefits of plants to buildings performance and make part of a sustainable strategy of urban rehabilitation and buildings retrofitting. During the last decades several researches were conducted proving that green walls can contribute to enhance and restore the urban environment and improve buildings performance. The aim of this paper is to review all types of green wall systems in order to identify and systematize their main characteristics and technologies involved. So, it is important to understand the main differences between systems in terms of composition and construction methods. Most recent developments in green walls are mainly focused in systems design in order to achieve more efficient technical solutions and a better performance in all building phases. Yet, green wall systems must evolve to become more sustainable solutions. In fact, continuing to evaluate the contribution of recent green wall systems to improve buildings performance and comparing the environmental impact of these systems with other construction solutions can lead to an increase of their application in buildings and therefore result in a reduction on these systems cost. The decision of which green wall system is more appropriate to a certain project must depend not only on the construction and climatic restrictions but also on the environmental impact of its components and associated costs during its entire lifecycle.},

abstract = {Societies are in a need for making a conscious choice to switch to a more sustainable way of life. Design, construction, and maintenance of buildings have a tremendous impact on the environment and the natural resources. All around the world, a huge amount of buildings are being constructed with many more to be done. The challenge will be to build them smart with a minimal usage of non-renewable energy, minimal production of pollution, and minimal cost of energy dollars. Other important issues in building include increasing the comfort, health, and safety of people who live and work in them. Indeed, buildings consume many of the natural resources and are responsible for many problems. Now, in the 21st century, people are slowly beginning to realize the necessity of green architecture where new aspects and technologies started to emerge in terms of green buildings such as green walls which are considered a new prospect for the phenomenon of urban heat island and energy conservation aspects [1,5]. This research will display the meanings, the advantages and the techniques of the living wall as a part of the sustainable strategy for the urban environment. The Green vertical surfaces can contribute significant environmental, social and economic benefits to the built environment. moreover the research will display why this emerging technology should be considered as a valuable part of the design process for addressing climate change and energy crisis. The living wall could also function for urban agriculture, urban gardening, or for its beauty as art. It is sometimes built indoors to help alleviate sick building syndrome. Living walls are particularly suitable for cities, as they allow good use of available vertical surface areas. They are also suitable in arid areas, as the circulating water on a vertical wall is less likely to evaporate than in horizontal gardens. Finally, the research will conclude with several recommendations for the using of living walls technique which suits the arid climate as a part of sustainable strategy for the urban environment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
