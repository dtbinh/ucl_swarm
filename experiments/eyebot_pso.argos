      System configuration:
      - threads: the number of slave threads to parallelize the
        computation. For less than 100 robots thread management is not
        beneficial, so here we set it to 0. When set to 0, it means that
        the computation is not parallelized: the main thread does
        everything.
    -->
    <system threads="0" />
    <!--
      Experiment configuration:
      - length: total experiment time in seconds (0 means the experiment
        has no time limit)
      - method: task assignment method for the threads (balance_quantity for
          homogeneous, balance_length for heterogeneous).
      - ticks_per_second: number of ticks per second (int value)
      - random_seed: seed of the main random number generator. If unset
        or set to zero, this value is taken from the clock and a warning
        message is displayed.

      Here you list the controllers to be used in the experiment.
      The XML tag is set by the REGISTER_CONTROLLER(class, "tag") macro.
      You find it in the .cpp file of your controller.
      For this example, the macro is called in
      controllers/footbot_diffusion.cpp:100.

      The attributes are:
      - id: a unique a identifier for this controller, to be used in the

        controller
      - library: the path to the compiled library containing you
        controller.

        The <actuators> section contains a list of the actuators used by
        this controller.
        If you forget a to mention an actuator here and then request it
        in the controller, an error occurs.

        Multiple implementations of an actuator are possible. To
        identify which one you want to use, pass it in the
        'implementation' attribute below. When you type the 'argos3 -q'
        command, the implementation is in the square brackets following
        the name of the device:

    In ARGoS, multiple physics engines can run at the same time.

    Here you specify the media in use. Media allow robots to communicate.
    In this experiment, robots do not communicate, so no media are

    To know which media are available, type at the command prompt:

  <!--
    Here you specify which visualization to use.
    You can also not specify a visualization at all, in which case ARGoS
    will run without showing anything.
    Having no visualization is useful when you run ARGoS in a batch of
    experiments to collect statistics.
