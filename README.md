# An Evaluation of Swarm Algorithms

This code accompanies my thesis project on Swarm Algorithms.

## Requirements
You need the following software installed:
- [Argos3](https://www.argos-sim.info)
- [Buzz](https://the.swarming.buzz)

Ensure that you've set the ARGOS_PLUGIN_PATH environment to point to your Argos Libraries. Compile the buzz script with the ```bzzc swarm.bzz``` command.
